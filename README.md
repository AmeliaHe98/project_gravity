# Welcome to the Project Gravity!

We're studying computer science @NTNU, and are doing a project for SINTEF as our final bachelor project.
The main goal of the project is to make a fall detection system using an Android phone and watch. We'll try to make the detection more reliable by using the accelerometer and other sensors from both devices. Other goals include the use of multiple algorithms and refine the detection system.
